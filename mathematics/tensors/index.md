# Tensors

Due to the bloom of machine learn, especially deep learning, the term "tensor"
loosely means a multidimension array. However, in mathematics and physics,
tensors are define through coordinate transformations and not all multidimensional
arrays represents tensors.

Cartesian tensors are used in the study of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics.
Tensors in general coordinates are essential for studying general relatively and
differential geometry.
