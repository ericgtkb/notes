# Groups

## Definition of a Group

A set of elements $\qty{A, B, C, \dots}$ form a group if it satisfies the following
group axioms:

1. The product of any two elements is also an element of the group. All elements
$C$s of the form $C = AB$ are also elements of the group for any two $A$ and $B$ in the group.

2. The associative law $(AB)C = A(BC)$ holds.

3. There exists an element $E$ such that $EA = AE = A$ for all $A$s in the group.
The element $E$ is called the ***identity element***.

4. For each element $A$ in the group, there exists an element $A^{-1}$ also
in the group such that $A^{-1}A = AA^{-1} = E$. The element $A^{-1}$ is called
the ***inverse element*** of $A$.

Groups having infinite number of elements are called ***infinite groups***. Groups
having finite number of elements are called ***finite groups***.

In general the commutative law does not hold: $AB \neq BA$. However, if any two
elements $A$ and $B$ of a group commute $AB = BA$ the group is called
a ***commutative group*** or an ***Abelian*** group.

## Simple Examples

Let's consider a few simple examples of groups.

### An Equilateral triangle
A general rotation operation can be denoted by $R(\phi)$ about a given axis.
For counterclockwise rotation $\phi \gt 0$ and for clockwise rotation $\phi \lt 0$.

### A Square
