# Computer Science

Computer science covers a wide range of topics: programming, algorithms, software engineering,
machine learning, artifitial intelligence etc., just to name a few. Here I cover
the more formal theoretical topics. For topics about specific programming languages,
software tools/libraries, and impelemetation details see the [technology] section of my notes.

Unlike the [physics] section, here I do not intend to cover most topics
in computer science, but only the topics that I have personally studied.

[Quantum computation] and [quantum information] can very well be a subscetion
under physics, but I think a lot of the application is more relavent to computer
science and thus listed as subbranches of computer science here.
