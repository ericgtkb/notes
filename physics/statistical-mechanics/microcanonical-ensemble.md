# The Microcanonical Ensemble

## Microstates and Macrostates
A physical system at the fundamental level is described by quantum mechanics, or
to some appropriate approximations, classical mechanics. By solving the equations
of motion of the whole system, we can fully describe how the system evolves.

In quantum mechanics, the solution to the equations of motion gives us all the
possible states of the system. In classical mechanics we solve the equations of
motion to obtain the trajectory of the system given the initial condition
of the system.

In either case, the full description by solving the eqluations of montion gives
us the ***microstates*** of the system. For classical mechanics, we will see
later that these microstates correspond to the phase space volume the system
occupies.

For a system with high degrees of freedom, describing
the system with miscrostates is impractical, and we often need a statistical
description of the system. These coarse-grained states describing of the system
are called ***macrostates***. For example, a macrostate of a close system can
be described using $E$, $N$, and $V$, the total energy, the total number of
particles, and the total volume of the system.

We will begin with the formal description of microstates, and show that
through statistical methods, we can arrive at the macrostates. All thermodynamic
quantities can then be calculated.
