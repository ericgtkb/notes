# Physics

I tried to organize the various banches of physics in the order of difficulty,
but this order can be quite subjective. The order of different branches here is
a rough combination of relevance and proper learning order. However, these branches
of physics are often intertwined so the order below is still some what arbitrary.
For example special relativity could be placed right after classical mechanics or
classical electrodynamics, but is placed next to general relativity for relevance.
Conecepts in different braches often appear in many other branches. I try to reference
the relavent pages as needed.
