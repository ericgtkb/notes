# Technology

This section is where I put my notes on various different topics in technology.
Technology in general covers all different domains in science and engineering.
Here I mostly focus on programming, software engineering, and data science, and
cover topics such as programming languages, machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc.
More formal/theoretical notes on some topics can be found in
[computer science].
